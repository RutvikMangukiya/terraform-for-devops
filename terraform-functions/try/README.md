## try Function:
- The try function is a powerful utility that attempts to evaluate a list of expressions in order.
- It returns the result of the first expression that does not produce an error. This is particularly useful for error handling and providing fallback values when working with resources or variables that may not always be available.

## Syntax:
- `try(expression1, expression2, ...)`
- `expression1, expression2, ...`: A list of expressions to evaluate in order. The function returns the result of the first expression that succeeds without error.
